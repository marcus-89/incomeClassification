## Summary

This project investigates the performance of four machine learning algorithms on the [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) data set `adult`. The *income* variable is recoded into a binary variable of {<= 50k, >50k}. The four algorithms tested are classification tree, random forest and logistic regression and SVM (only briefly since it was outside of the scope of the course this project took place within). Some common performance key values such as misclassification rate, sensitivity and specificity are calculated. Moreover, ROC curves are looked at to investigate optimal cut-offs.
